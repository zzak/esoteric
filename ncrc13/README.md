# The Esoteric Library for Nickel City Ruby Conference 2013

* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/zzak/the-esoteric-library-number-ncrc13)

Have you ever wondered what that ~20MB of code in your Ruby installation is
there for? You didn't know Ruby came with an eso- standard library?! Well it
totally does, and there's a lot of hidden gems in there just waiting for you to
uncover.

Allow me to guide you through some of the more delightful members of the
standard library. I will hand pick libraries authored by the pioneers of Ruby
and show you the useful bits.

Together we'll discover the bountiful archive of libraries that come packaged
with Ruby.
